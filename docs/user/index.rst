Permafrost Benchmark System
===========================

Getting Started Guide
---------------------

The **Permafrost Benchmark System** (PBS)
wraps the command-line
`ILAMB <https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb>`_
benchmarking software with a customized version of the
`CSDMS Web Modeling Tool
<https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Web_Modeling_Tool>`_ (WMT),
and adds tools for uploading
`CMIP5-compatible <https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/output_req.html>`_
model outputs and benchmark datasets.
The PBS allows users to access and run ILAMB remotely,
without having to install software or data locally;
a web browser on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer
is all thatâ€™s needed.
