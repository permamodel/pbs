# Permafrost Benchmark System

The **Permafrost Benchmark System** (PBS)
is a customized version of the
[CSDMS Web Modeling Tool](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Tools_portal#WMT)
(WMT).
It wraps the command-line-driven
[ILAMB](https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb)
benchmarking software with a web interface,
and includes tools for uploading
[CMIP5-compatible](https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/output_req.html)
model outputs and benchmark datasets.
The PBS allows users to access and run ILAMB remotely,
without having to install software or data locally;
a web browser on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer
is all that's needed.


This project is supported by
NASA grant NNX16AB19G,
