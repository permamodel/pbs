# Permafrost Benchmark System

The **Permafrost Benchmark System** (PBS)
wraps the command-line
[ILAMB](https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb)
benchmarking software with a customized version of the
[CSDMS Web Modeling Tool](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Web_Modeling_Tool)
(WMT), and adds tools for uploading
[CMIP5-compatible](https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/output_req.html)
model outputs and benchmark datasets.
The PBS allows users to access and run ILAMB remotely,
without having to install software or data locally;
a web browser on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer
is all that's needed.
