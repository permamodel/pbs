# Permafrost Benchmark System

The **Permafrost Benchmark System** (PBS)
is an [open source](./LICENSE) web application
for conducting benchmarking studies of permafrost models.
The PBS wraps the command-line
[ILAMB](https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb)
benchmarking system with a customized version of the
[CSDMS Web Modeling Tool](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/CSDMS_Web_Modeling_Tool)
(WMT), and adds tools for uploading
CMIP5-compatible model outputs and benchmark datasets.
The PBS allows users to access and run ILAMB remotely,
without having to install software or data locally;
a web browser on a desktop, laptop, or tablet computer
is all that's needed.

The PBS home page is https://permamodel.github.io/pbs.
It contains links for registration and documentation.

This work is supported under NASA award 14-CMAC14-NNX16AB19G,
*A Permafrost Benchmark System to Evaluate Permafrost Models*.
